Deployment Report for Node Application with PostgreSQL Database

Overview
This report outlines the process and decisions made to set up the deployment pipelines for a simple Node application using a PostgreSQL database. The primary focus was to use GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD), along with deployment on an AWS EC2 instance. The tasks were partially completed due to specific challenges encountered.

Completed Tasks
1. Setting Up GitHub Actions for Pipelines
2. Environment Configuration
3. CI Pipeline for Lint, Test, and Build
4. Continuous Delivery with Version Tagging and GitHub Release
7. Documentation of Decisions in DeploymentManual.md
8. Pull Request Management with Proper Commit Messages

Task Descriptions and Implementations

1. GitHub Actions for Pipelines
Description: Set up GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD processes.
Implementation: 
- Created `.github/workflows` directory in the repository.
- Added YAML files to define the workflows for CI and CD.

2. Environment Configuration
Description: Configure environment variables for PostgreSQL connections.
Implementation:
- Created `.env` and `.env.test` files based on `.env.example`.
- Ensured that environment variables for database connections were correctly set up.

3. CI Pipeline for Lint, Test, and Build
Description: Set up CI pipeline to lint, test, and build the application.
Implementation:
- Defined a GitHub Actions workflow to run on push and pull request events.
- Used commands from `package.json` to run linting, testing, and building.
- Included steps to check Docker build.

Problems and Solutions:
- Lint Not Set Up: Configured ESLint based on standard conventions.
- Missing Files Issue: Ensured all necessary files were present in the repository.

4. Continuous Delivery with Version Tagging and GitHub Release
Description: Implement a CD pipeline to tag versions and create GitHub releases.
Implementation:
- Used external GitHub Actions for version tagging and release management.

Problems and Solutions:
- Tag Name Generating Issue: Resolved by using a standard version bump action.

7. Documentation in DeploymentManual.md
Description: Document all decisions and processes.
Implementation: 
- Created `DeploymentManual.md` detailing each step taken, commands used, and configurations made.

8. Pull Request Management
Description: Ensure proper pull request management with appropriate commit messages.
Implementation: 
- Created pull requests for each pipeline.
- Used meaningful commit messages to describe changes.

Incomplete Tasks and Reasons

5. Deployment Pipeline with Rollback Capability
Reason for Incompletion: 
- Issue with SSH Private Key Authentication: Unable to authenticate using SSH private keys provided, blocking the setup of deployment pipeline.

6. Deployment on EC2 Instance
Reason for Incompletion: 
- Connection Issues: Could not establish a connection from the local machine to the AWS server, preventing deployment.

9. Additional Development and Test Scripts
Reason for Incompletion: 
- Time Constraints and Connection Issues: The inability to connect to the AWS server also impacted the completion of this task. 

Encountered Problems and Solutions

Lint Not Set Up
Problem: ESLint configuration was missing.
Solution: Configured ESLint using standard configurations and added relevant commands to `package.json`.

Missing Files Issue
Problem: Some necessary files were missing.
Solution: Identified missing files and added them to the repository.

Tag Name Generating Issue
Problem: Generating tag names for releases was problematic.
Solution: Used an external action for version bumping and tagging.

Manual Testing
Problem: Errors required extensive manual testing.
Solution: Manually tested to identify and fix issues, then automated tests where possible.

SSH Private Key Authentication
Problem: Unable to authenticate using provided SSH private keys.
Solution: Despite multiple attempts and configuration adjustments, the issue persisted. Documented the problem for further troubleshooting.

Connection to AWS Server
Problem: Could not connect from local machine to AWS server.
Solution: Documented the issue and recommended further investigation.

Conclusion
Despite encountering several challenges, the assignment was partially completed. The core CI/CD pipelines were successfully set up, with detailed documentation provided in `DeploymentManual.md`. However, due to SSH and connectivity issues, the deployment pipeline and additional scripts were not fully implemented.

Future Recommendations
1. Resolve SSH Authentication Issues: Investigate and resolve SSH private key authentication issues to enable deployment.
2. Establish Reliable AWS Connection: Ensure stable connection to the AWS server for successful deployment.
3. Automate Manual Steps: Further automate manual testing and setup steps to streamline the process.

By addressing these issues, the deployment process can be fully realized, ensuring robust and reliable CI/CD pipelines.
